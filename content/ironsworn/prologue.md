> The camera flies over a snow covered forest until it hits upon a rocky cliff face. It climbs up to reveal the small village of Lowhope where children are sparring with blunted spears.  They are under the supervision of a large woman with a braids of black hair and skin of smooth, red-brown ochre.

> One the children falls, and his opponent seizes the opportunity and drives her stave into his gut. The woman calls out “Kione, child of Khinara. If you keep tripping over your spear like that, I swear to the old gods that we will cancel your name day!” Her stern voice belies her care for the child, as she is already checking him over and making sure he is alright as the camera leaves them.

> The camera flies above the thatched proved and begins to follow the sound of hammer striking iron. It enters through a window, where they show our PC--Wynne, Child of No one--working. He is bald, with tawny, yellow-brown skin. He is quenching his blade when a horn sounds. Two short bursts.

Wynne dropped the spearhead and grabs a spear on his way out the door. Two bursts meant a raid by the Broken. A feral people without the capacity for speech or reason. They didn't often head into the village proper, and those that do are quickly scared off. But there are those that pity the Broken, and sometimes they will make off with an arm full from our stores or with a clucking chicken. They were a nuisance in the Iron Lands, but are as much a fixture of it as the winter snows.

Wynne could see immediately that this was different. The broken were carrying lit bundles of brush like torches. The flames were already licking at their hands. There shouts of gibberish mush have been as much from pain as anything else. The large woman's voice calls out clearly in the din. "Granary!"

Wynne turned and ran while others around him continued to gawk. By the time he arrived at their storehouse, it was already catching. Broken danced around it as if it were a festival.

    Enter the Fray: 4 vs 10 & 9, miss
    Broken are normally troublesome, but in this group, they're difficult
    
The Broken catch sight of him and circle around Wynne. He will have to watch helplessly as the store house --- and their food for the winter --- burns unless he can deal with the attackers.

    Endure Stress: 6|2,5, Strong hit.
    
"... Fuck." Wynne spins slowly, trying to keeping all of the broken in sight as best he can before going in for a strike.

    Strike: Weak hit
    
His spear bites deep, and Wynne could feel the iron bite into bone.

And stick there.

The newly impaled broken grabbed hold of the spear and held it there with his dying strength. The other broken lunged, only to be met with a massive ball of toasted marshmallow colored fluff and teeth.

"Good girl, Ivy."

    Clash [6|5&8]: Weak hit
    
Finally managing to pull his spear free, Wynne whirls to block a blow before Ivy lunges again, scoring a bite on an arm.

    Secure an advantage [8|4&4]: Opportunity
    Opportunity = It starts to snow

Wynne manages to maneuver the broken until they are pressed up against a wall with no where to retreat.

    End the Fight [8|3&6]: Strong hit
    
With a powerful lunge, Wynne's spear drives through a man an impales him and the wall behind. The last remaining opponent flees as Wynne could feel wetness from falling snow that had melted from the heat of the fire. At least the fire will be put out.

Nyssa, the woman who was training the younglings, is examining the storehouse. "Fuck", she says. "We're not in no danger of starving right this second, but we were _already_ going to have a lean winter.

"It was my fault." Says Wynne. "I'll make sure the village survives the winter." He touches his spearhead to his chest over his heart. "I swear it."

    Swear an Iron vow [4|4&2]: Weak hit

Nyssa quirks an eyebrow. "And how do you plan on doing that."

"I'll head to Axebridge. I'll figure it out from there."

"You have the most _detailed_ plans.

Wynne smiled. "I wasn't the one who decided to Draw the circle over a kid crying. And now you have to deal with being village chief.

"That dottering woolhead deserved it. He's a grown man. He wasn't sparring with Kione as much as bullying him just because he could."

"And you had to go and show him that someone could to that to _him_ too, huh?"

"It wasn't going to be you. Your spearwork is just a step and a half above Kione's.

Wyne starts to say thing but stops. Abruptly, he says "I'll leave in the morning when I have more sun."

When he makes his way back to his smith with Ivy when the dog starts sniffing at something and bounds her way in, barking. "What is it, Girl? Broken hiding in there?"

The dog's barking turns into a concerned whisper as if in response.


Walking in with his spear at the ready, he finds a broken woman in the back corner of the room. At first, Wynne things she's painted her skin with garish crimson before he realizes that it's her own blood. Far too much for her to survive. She has a bundle in her arm.

She is repeating herself. It's starting to sound familiar. Confused, Wynne concentrates on it. It sounds... like Skulde.

"Please... Please.... no kill. Protect"

Wynne, on his knees, takes the bundle as the woman loses her strength and passes to the next life.

He unwraps the bundle.

He finds a child. No more than 2 winters old.

And he has shockingly bright blue hair.

"What the fuck." 

Ivy licks the child as it whimpers.

Somehow, this child is of Skulde blood.

Like Wynne himself.

"What. The. Fuck"
