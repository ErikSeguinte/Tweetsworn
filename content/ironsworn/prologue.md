The camera flies over a snow covered forest until it hits upon a rocky cliff face. It climbs up to reveal the small village of Lowhope where children are sparring with blunted spears.  They are under the supervision of a large woman with a braids of black hair and skin of smooth, red-brown ochre. 

One the children falls, and his opponent seizes the opportunity and drives her stave into his gut. The woman calls out “Kione, child of Khinara. If you keep tripping over your spear like that, I swear to the old gods that we will cancel your name day!” Her stern voice belies her care for the child, as she is already checking him over and making sure he is alright as the camera leaves them. 

The camera flies above the thatched proved and begins to follow the sound of hammer striking iron. It enters through a window, where they show our PC--Wynne, Child of No one--working. He is bald, with tawny, yellow-brown skin. He is quenching his blade when a horn sounds. Two short bursts.
