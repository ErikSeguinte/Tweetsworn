_The camera flies over a snow covered forest until it hits upon a rocky cliff face. It climbs up to reveal the small village of Lowhope where children are sparring with blunted spears.  They are under the supervision of a large woman with a braids of black hair and skin of smooth, red-brown ochre._

_One the children falls, and his opponent seizes the opportunity and drives her stave into his gut. The woman calls out “Kione, child of Khinara. If you keep tripping over your spear like that, I swear to the old gods that we will cancel your name day!” Her stern voice belies her care for the child, as she is already checking him over and making sure he is alright as the camera leaves them._

_The camera flies above the thatched proved and begins to follow the sound of hammer striking iron. It enters through a window, where they show our PC--Wynne, Child of No one--working. He is bald, with tawny, yellow-brown skin. He is quenching his blade when a horn sounds. Two short bursts._

Wynne dropped the spearhead and grabs a spear on his way out the door. Two bursts means a raid by the Broken. A feral people without the capacity for speech or reason. They didn't often head into the village proper, and those that do are quickly scared off. But there are those that pity the Broken, and sometimes they will make off with an arm full from our stores or with a clucking chicken. They were a nuisance in the Iron Lands, but are as much a fixture of it as the winter snows.

Wynne could see immediately that this was different. The broken were carrying lit bundles of brush like torches. The flames were already licking at their hands. There shouts of gibberish mush have been as much from pain as anything else. The large woman's voice calls out clearly in the din. "Granary!"

Wynne turned and ran while others around him continued to gawk. By the time he arrived at their storehouse, it was already catching. Broken danced around it as if it were a festival.
